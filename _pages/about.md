I am an AI researcher envisioning the next generation of creative software. I completed my Ph.D. in Mathematics in 2018 under the supervision of [Prof. Michel X. Goemans](https://math.mit.edu/~goemans/) at [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://math.mit.edu/). After completing my Ph.D., I worked as a research scientist at Kakao Brain from November 2018 to February 2024, where I contributed to several breakthrough projects in vision generative models. I then worked at [Runway](https://runwayml.com/) as a senior member of technical staff from March 2024 to May 2025, where I substantially contributed to the development of Gen-3 Alpha Turbo and Gen-4 Turbo flagship models.
